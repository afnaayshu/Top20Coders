## About Me

Hi, I'm Afna Ayshu Jaffin, a final-year CSE student pursuing my Bachelor's degree. With a strong passion for technology, I have actively participated in several hackathons, gaining hands-on experience in software development. I was awarded a special mention for GDG Cloud Kochi's AI Adapt Search competition on Kaggle, which further fueled my interest in the field of artificial intelligence. I possess a good grasp of the basics of programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, and I'm currently learning React to develop my skills further.I am also a graphic designer. I use Abode Photoshop and Figma for the same. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow in my field, and I believe that my enthusiasm and dedication make me a valuable asset to any project. Connect with me to explore exciting possibilities!

### Leadership and Influence

I embarked on my leadership journey by joining the IEEE student branch executive committee (ExeCom) in my first year of college. I started as the electronics communication coordinator, where my responsibilities included creating, monitoring, and posting content for social media in a timely manner. After gaining experience in various design communities, I now hold the position of design mentor for the IEEE SB SJCET.

### Opinion on Indian Engineering Education and SJCET Palai

The Indian engineering education system could benefit significantly from a curriculum overhaul that prioritizes application-based learning.  Let's take Computer Science Engineering (CSE) as an example.  Here's a proposed approach:

Foundational Year: Introduce students to various computer science fields through introductory courses.  Cover essential core subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to provide a strong foundation.

Specialization and Exploration (Year 2 & 3):  Empower students to choose a specialization within CSE, like web development, game development, or machine learning. Offer in-depth courses and projects in their chosen niche to foster expertise.

Real-World Experience Integration (Year 4): Dedicate time for students to gain practical experience through internships or industry projects. This will hone their technical skills and bridge the gap between theory and application.

Lifelong Learning and Curiosity Cultivation: Integrate elements within the curriculum that promote continual learning and general knowledge upkeep.  Additionally, encourage extracurricular activities to nurture creativity and a sense of wonder. This will keep students' "inner child" alive and fuel their intellectual curiosity throughout their careers.

This revamped curriculum prioritizes application-based learning, allows for specialization, integrates real-world experience, and encourages a lifelong love of learning. It equips students with the necessary skills to thrive in the dynamic world of technology.
